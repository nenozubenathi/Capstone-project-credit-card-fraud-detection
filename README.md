The Credit Card Fraud Detection project seeks to develop a predictive model capable of accurately distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate credit card transactions.
The main deliverable is a highly accurate classification system, built using a number of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and an Ensemble Stacking model.
The practical impact of this project is to provide financial institutions with a robust fraud detection tool that minimizes the occurrence of fraudulent transactions and enhances customer trust by preventing financial losses.
The project operates in the financial services domain, particularly within the realm of credit card transactions. 
The client could be financial institutions like credit card companies or banks, with the primary goal of identifying fraudulent transactions in real time. 
The findings from this project will benefit fraud analysts, risk management teams, and financial institutions aiming to secure customer accounts and mitigate fraud risks.
The project will also benefit individuals with credit cards.
